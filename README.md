# KCWI: data manipulation codes to share between PC and linux
#
# Contains codes used to manipulate KCWI data cubes.
#
# Currently designed to look specifically at M57 data cubes:
#   - read in and store data, coordinates
#   - create narrow-band images around PNe-specific emission lines
#   - stitch together images taken of different regions of M57
#
# Codes created:
#   kcwi_datacube_general.py
#       - Was supposed to be a way to open and manipulate any KCWI data cubes, as long as data was reduced to the *_icube.fits level.
#       - Has been abandoned for now...
#   kcwi_image_shift.py
#       - 
#   kcwi_scube_fix.py
#   m57_kcwi_datacube_june.py
# 
# Codes in progress:
#   - Veleocity/dynamics plots and analysis
#   -
